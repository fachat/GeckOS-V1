- serial line drivers ignore handshake value (rts/cts vs. xon/xoff)

- serial line (UART driver) interrupts increase cursor speed...

- dropped characters above 2400 baud with FIFO still seems strange,
  esp with a 16550A!

- not really a bug but annoying: Semaphores are polled in the scheduler,
  instead of the task being set READY when the semaphore is freed 

- the terminal device can leave an inverted space when pressing return
