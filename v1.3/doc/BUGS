- serial line drivers ignore handshake value (rts/cts vs. xon/xoff)

- not really a bug, but: Semaphores are polled in the scheduler,
  instead of the task being set READY when the semaphore is freed 

- the terminal device can leave an inverted space when pressing return

- don't use "." as prefix for decimal values in monitor, but "#"

- Backspace from serial line / vt100 doesn't work on serial line

- in monitor: go command with piped in STDIN doesn't work

- monitor should understand at least the simple CMOS opcodes

- monitor command "e" should allow more than one consecutive exchanges at a 
  time

- SLIP has to allow more than 250 bytes in a packet!

- FSIEC handling of error channel is not correct (when reading it partially,
  it seems not to be reset), which shows mostly when two OS/A talk to each 
  other...
