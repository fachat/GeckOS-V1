Most kernel routines return an error code in the accumlator (a), if the
carry flag is reset upon return. Otherwise the ac might contain data.

-------------------------------------------

$f000  	RESET   System reset
$f003	NMI	Non-maskable interrupt
$f006	IRQ	Interrupt routine

-------------------------------------------

$f009	GETMEM	Get a free memory block. Returns block number in x.
$f00c	FREMEM	release memory block, parameter: block number in x
$f00f	GETBLK	Tries to allocate a specified memory block, block number in x
$f012	ENMEM	registers usable memory block to memory subsystem,
		parameter: block number in x.

-------------------------------------------

$f015	GETSTR	Get a free stream. increase read and write task counter,
		returns stream number in x
$f018	FRESTR	decreases read and write task counter, thus freeing the
		stream, if both result in zero. parameter: stream number in x
$f01b	PUTC	puts a byte on the stream. parameter: stream number in x,
		data byte in a. returns errorcode in a
$f01e	GETC	Get a byte from the stream. parameter: stream number in x,
		returns data byte in a (with carry=0) or error code 
		(carry=1)
$f021	UNGETC	Gives byte from stream back. parameter: stream number in x,
		data byte in a, returns error code in a
$f024	STRCMD	executes a stream command. parameter: stream number in x,
		stream command in a, returns error code in a.

		possible stream commands are:

		SC_GET		0	same as GETSTR
		SC_REG_RD	1	increase read task counter by one
		SC_REG_WR	2	increase write task counter by one
		SC_CLR		3	empty the stream
		SC_EOF		4	closing the stream from the sender 
					side, i.e. decrease write task 
					counter by one
		SC_NUL		5	closing the stream from the receiver
					side, i.e. decrease read task 
					counter.
		SC_FRE		6	same as FRESTR
		SC_STAT		7	read stream status
		SC_GANZ		8	returns number of bytes in stream in a
		SC_RWANZ	9	returns the stream write pointer in
					a and the stream read pointer in y

		Possible stream status are:

		E_NUL		Noone reading from stream
				(i.e. read task counter is zero)
		E_EOF		stream is empty and noone is writing anymore
				(i.e. write task counter is zero)
		E_SEMPTY	stream buffer is empty
		E_SFULL		stream buffer is full
		E_SLWM		number of bytes below Low Water Mark 
				(1/4 buffer size)
		E_SHWM		number of bytes above Hogh Water Mark
				(3/4 buffer size)

-------------------------------------------

$f027	DEVCMD	executes device commands. parameter: device number in x,
		device command in a, optional parameter in y.
		returns error code in a.

		possible stream commands are:

		DC_IRQ		0	execute IRQ routine
					the interrupt routine has to return
					E_OK if an interrupt source is cleared
					or E_NOIRQ if not.
		DC_RES		1	initialize device
		DC_GS		2	sets the stream (in y) the device 
					reads from
		DC_PS		3	sets the stream (in y) the device 
					writes to
		DC_RX_ON	4	switch on receive
		DC_TX_ON	5	switch off receive
		DC_RX_OFF	6	switch on send
		DC_TX_OFF	7	switch off send
	
		DC_SPD		8	set speed (in y), device dependend
		DC_HS		9	set handshake (in y), device dependend
		DC_ST		10	get device status, device dependend
		DC_EXIT		11	disable device, including IRQ sources

		DC_GNAM		16	get the name of a device, parameter:
					device number in x, returns 
					name PCBUF ($0200)
		DC_GNUM		17	get number of a device from name,
					parameter: name in PCBUF, length
					of name in x, returns device number 
					in x
		DC_REGDEV	18	register new device(s)

		With the registration of the device the system has to know
		what to do with it and where to put it in memory.
		Therefore you have to put the following struct in PCBUF.
		
		REGDEV_MPOS	0	address (position in memory map, i.e.
					upper 4 bits, 0-14) of device block 
					when being executed
		REGDEV_MBLK	1	memory block number of device block
					where the code is in
		REGDEV_ADR	2	two-byte start address of the 
					following:

		
		REGDEV_ADR ->  	2 byte pointer to label1
				JMP Start_of_1st_device
				Name_of_device,0
				...
		label1		2 byte pointer to label2
				JMP Start_of_2nd_device
				Name_of_2nd_device,0
				...
		labeln		$ffff
 
		
		With this method it is possible to register several devices,
		as long as they are in one memory block, with one call.
		
		The devices are started with DC_RESET. In y they get a
		system feature byte. Currently only bit 7 is defined,
		where $00 is 1 MHz system clock and $80 is 2 MHz system clock.

-------------------------------------------

$f02a	GETENV	get a free environment and reserve the memory. parameter:
		wanted memory size in kByte in y, returns env number in x
		The memory is allocated from address 0 on.
$f02d	FREENV	frees environment. parameter: env number in x
$f030	SETBLK	carry=1: changes in a specified env. the mapping for a 
		memory block. parameter: env number in x, position in 
		memory map (0-14) in y, new memory block in a,
		returns old memory block on this position in a
$f033	FORK	start a new task. parameter: length of the following
		struct in PCBUF in y

		FORK_ENV	0	env to start task in
					the env number is identical to the
					task id
		FORK_STDIN	1	stdin stream

		FORK_STDERR	3	stderr stream
		FORK_ADR	4	start address of task
		FORK_NAME	6	name of task, ended by a nullbyte.
					then command line that started
					the program.

		The commandline is put into the PCBUF of the starting 
		task. The new task gets its own task id in x
		The stream read/write task counter are incremented 
		appropriately, i.e. for the out streams the write counter
		and for STDIN the read counter.
$f036	TERM	ends to own task. parameter: return code in a, which is given
		to other tasks waiting on it
$f039	KILL	ends another task. parameter: return code in a, task id in x
$f03c	SUSPEND	just give control back to the scheduler, as there is nothing
		to do at the moment - but keep running (not needed for
		preemtive multitasking, an interrupt interrupts any task!)
$f03f	WTERM	wait for a certain task to end. parameter: task id in x,
		returns error code.
$f042	GETINFO	get in info block of the running processes into PCBUF.
		16 tasks (ANZ_ENV) a available at maximum and each task 
		structure is 16 byte long

		TN_ST		0	task status

					(0=none)
		TN_STDIN	5	stdin stream

-------------------------------------------

$f05a	SEND	send a message to another task

-------------------------------------------


On bootup the system is tested and possible errors are detected.
On systems with a system port, the hardware error is shown by the number
of flashes the LED makes before the system reboots
