In 1989, after my first semester at university, I made the first line
on the schematics for a small self-designed and self-built computer.
This computer, based on the 6502 CPU, has until 1992 become a small
computer system. But from then I only occasionally worked on it.
</p><p>
Well, after someone asked me to release it to the public, I decided
to overhaul the documentation, translate it to english and put it 
under the <a href="COPYING">GNU public license</a>.

<img src="../icons/new.gif" alt="[NEW!]"> Version 1.3.10 now supports the C64,
including the new fast serial RS232 interface by Daniel Dallmann, and
has some better NMI support.
<a href="new.html">Here</a> is a short introduction to what has changed since
the last published version, 1.3.6g.
</p><p>

including the html docs and a pre-assembled 'c64rom' image.
<p><li> <a href="oa1310a.lzh">oa1310a.lzh</a>, the source code,
including the html docs as well as a 'c64rom' assembled ROM image,
for the DOS people who cannot use my cross assembler... 
<p><li> How to <a href="build.html">build</a> the binaries
<p><li> A description of the <a href="files.txt">files</a> in the archive

Well, when I did this project, it was just for fun. But now I find it
quite nice. Well, if you know some magazin that would like to publish
some of it, I will be glad writing an article or so (if anybody really
wants it ;-)<br>
But on the other hand my interests have moved. I will gladly receive patches
and fixes and even new programs - but I will not continue working on it
(at least for a considerable time). I have other things to do (although this
stuff is real fun!)
