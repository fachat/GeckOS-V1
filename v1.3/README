This is the source code for the OS/A65 multitasking operating system for
6502 computer. It is designed to work with a CS/A65 computer system. But
then the kernel is completely hardware independent, so that it should
be quite easy to port it to other 6502 computer. See oa1.html for more
details.

The source is copyrighted by Andre Fachat and is released under the
GNU public license. See the file COPYING for more details.

To build the binaries, a 6502 cross compiler has to be used. The source
is written to work with my 'xa' (version > 2.1.0), see my WWW page for the
source (it's under GNU public license).

To compile, you have to put xa into the path. A simple "make" should
then be enough. You will find several programs, i.e. *.obj files in the
main directory.

The doc directory contains the english html documentation.
