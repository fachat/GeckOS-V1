TODO list for version 1.4
-------------------------

- make memtask not a subroutine but a 'JMP memtask' saves some stack
  handling. Add a "pushuser" call to push a return address or a byte 
  on a task stack.
 
- The memory mangement from the slip driver should be put to the 
  stdio lib and made working for MMU and non-MMU systems

- Exec code -> stdio library, loading stub to new env and let it 
  load itself

- exec relocator / binary format for relocator

- TCP layer for SLIP
