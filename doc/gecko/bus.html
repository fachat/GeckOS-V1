<hr>
The bus connector is a 96 pin connector according to DIN 41612, type C,
where only 64 pins (rows a+c) are used.
The board itself has the male connector. It can be plugged into a bus 
plane with female connectors.
<p>
The bus layout is:

For non-MMU systems like <a href="../gecko/index.html"><b>Gecko</b></a>
only the lines <b>A0-A11, D0-D7, Phi2, R/-W, -RES, -IRQ, -NMI, -IOSEL</b>
are necessary. Still some of the other lines need to be taken care of.
(-MEMSEL must be pushed high).
<li> -MEMSEL and -IOSEL are memory selection lines. If -MEMSEL goes low
(active), address lines A0-A19 must be valid. If -IOSEL goes low, then
only address lines A0-A11 must be valid. Both lines are <b>not</b>
open collector lines (although this is one of the few 'known bugs' of
this design)! 
The select lines are generated by the CPU. 
To map the I/O address space somewhere else, -IOSEL must be pulled low
when an address in the selected area is accessed. Thus -MEMSEL <b>and</b>
-IOSEL go then low on such an access. <br>
In MMU systems, the I/O space is normally mapped to some fixed location 
in the CPU address space and cannot be mapped around with the MMU. To avoid
this mapping, -IOINH must be pulled low. Warning: if you pull -IOINH and
not -EXTIO at any address, you lose access to the I/O area.
In the BIOS card for the MMU system, a control port can set these lines.
-IOINH and -EXTIO are open collector lines.
<li>
Vbuf is a battery buffered 5 Volt supply. Vcc is standard 5 Volt supply, 
respective to GND.
<li>
50Hz is a 50/50 phase 50 Hz TTL signal, generated from line frequency.
(In the U.S., you might generate it differently). <br>
16MHz is a 16 MHz clock.
<li> 
To drive some circuits synchronously with the CPU, there are 2Phi2 and 8Phi2.
2Phi2 has double the frequency than the CPU clock Phi2. At each 
transition of Phi2, 2Phi2 has a low-high transition. The high-low transition
follows about less than 100 ns later. I use 2Phi2 to directly drive
the -RAS signal of dynamic RAM.<br>
8Phi2 is the 8-times Phi2, but this signal has no fixed phase relation
to Phi2. I use it as pixel clock in a video card.<br>
Both signals are usually generated by the CPU.
<li> 
The lines that are not used (a9-a14) are reserved for future use.
