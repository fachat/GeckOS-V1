In 1989, after my first semester at university, I made the first line
on the schematics for a small self-designed and self-built computer.
This computer, based on the 6502 CPU, has until 1992 become a small
computer system. But from then I only occasionally worked on it.
</p><p>
Well, after someone asked me to release it to the public, I decided
to overhaul the documentation, translate it to english and put it 
under the <a href="COPYING">GNU public license</a>.
(Which, of course, doesn't hold true for the ported BASIC interpreter.
See this <a href="basic.html">file</a> for more.) 
</p><p>
<img src="../icons/new.gif" alt="[NEW!]"> Version 1.3.13 has an 
<font color="#ff0000">experimental TCP/SLIP implementation</font>, 
which is can be used as a <font color="#ff0000">client to a fileserver</font>
on the other side. Also a simple (and very Alpha, i.e. buggy!) 
<font color="#ff0000">WWW server</font> is included.
There is a <a href="README.slip">README</a> for the SLIP stuff.
<p>
<img src="../icons/new.gif" alt="[NEW!]"> Version 1.3.12 supports the
<i><font color="#ff0000"><a href="gecko/index.html">GECKO</a></font></i>
computer, a selfbuilt system without MMU. The schematics are
also on <a href="gecko">the site</a>!<p>
<a href="new-1.3.10.html">Here</a> is a short introduction to what has 
changed between versions 1.3.10 and 1.3.6g, because this is a more structural
change then the one up to 1.3.12.

Well, when I did this project, it was just for fun. But now I find it
quite nice. Well, if you know some magazin that would like to publish
some of it, I will be glad writing an article or so (if anybody really
wants it ;-)<br>
But on the other hand my interests have moved. 
Occasionally I still work on the project - when I have the time (or take
the time ;-) <br>
But after all, I don't really have time for it.
