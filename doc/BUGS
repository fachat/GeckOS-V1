- serial line drivers ignore handshake value (rts/cts vs. xon/xoff)

- not really a bug, but: Semaphores are polled in the scheduler,
  instead of the task being set READY when the semaphore is freed 

- the terminal device can leave an inverted space when pressing return
  Some key combinations give strange values, and others (esp. w/ one of 
  the shift keys) don't work - they then work with teh other shift key.

- Backspace from serial line / vt100 doesn't work on serial line

- in monitor: go command with piped in STDIN doesn't work

- monitor should understand at least the simple CMOS opcodes

- monitor command "e" should allow more than one consecutive exchanges at a 
  time

- SLIP has to allow more than 256 bytes in a packet!

- lots of more SLIP bugs.

- The FSIBM filesystem seems to break after some accesses...
  Also, when writing, it seems to lose characters. This must still be 
  confirmed!
