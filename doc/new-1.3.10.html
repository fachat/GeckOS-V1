<hr>
New things in this release are:
<ul>
<li> New GETB and PUTB kernel calls, to get and put a whole data block
from and to a stream. It is used by the FSIEC filesystem currently.
<li> New CTRLNMI kernel call, and modified SETNMI call. SETNMI now
sets the NMI routine address, and enables NMI routine chaining. There also
must be a link to a control routine that can enable and disable the NMI
line. Therefore FSIEC and FSIBM now call CTRLNMI to switch the NMI on and
off around their time critical regions.
<li> New device driver c64ds, that handles a 6551 ACIA for a C64.
<li> New device driver c64ds3, that handles the fast RS232 userport 
interface by Daniel Dallmann (see also comp.sys.cbm FAQ, for example)
with 9600 baud.
<li> New device driver oa1ds2, that handles an UART 16550A (with builtin
16 byte FIFO)
<li> New compile option STACKCOPY for systems without MMU. Allows more tasks
and gives each task more stack space.
<li> Introduced return code to device IRQ routines. This allows to return
from the IRQ routines prematurely, if one IRQ routine signals that it
has removed an IRQ source (if SYSINPORT is not available). 
</ul>
What's up for the next releases?
<ul>
<li> A dynamic memory mangement gets into the stdlib
<li> An executable loader with relocation
<li> A SLIP TCP/IP stack
</ul>
